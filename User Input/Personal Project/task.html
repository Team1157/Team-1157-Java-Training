<h1>Personal Project</h1>
<p>Before continuing, spend some time on a personal project. It can be anything! Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A four function calculator</li>
  <li>A digital version of Tic-Tac-Toe (bonus points for an AI opponent)</li>
  <li>A text based adventure game</li>
  <li>A digital version of the game "Mastermind" (Google it if you haven't played it)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have your own idea, even better! If you're not sure how to get started or how to structure your program, I'm more than happy to help!</p>
<p>Remember: our program can get user input using a Scanner, and can output text using System.out.println(). You'll need to use both frequently to make an interactive application.</p>
<p>One hint before you start: many games and applications run until the user specifically tells the program to quit. To ensure the program keeps running, most of the code is surrounded in a <code>while (true) { }</code> loop, which will run forever until it hits a <code>break</code> statement. An example of this kind of program is given with this task. As with the last task, this won't work when the "Run" button is used, use the green play button to the left of the editor or copy it into your own project.</p>
<p>Please ask me questions if you're stuck or you don't know how to do something. Good luck!</p>
