<h1>Creating a Project</h1>
<p>You now know everything you need to know to work on your own Java projects! Before we dive into objects and classes, I encourage you to spend some time working on your own programming project (I'll give you some ideas in the next task). But first, you'll need to know how to create a new project in IntelliJ:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to File->New->Project.</li>
  <li>Click "Next" twice, and you should see the option to name your project.</li>
  <li>Name your project something descriptive, and set the file location to something you'll be able to find later if you need to.</li>
  <li>Click "Finish".</li>
  <li>I recommend choosing "New Window", or this course will be replaced by your new project.
  <li>In the project view of your new project, expand the topmost folder by clicking on the gray arrow to its left.
  <li>Right click on the "src" folder and choose New->Java Class. Name the class <code>Main</code>.</li>
  <li>Copy and paste the code from this task into the "Main" class file.</li>
  <li>Run the program by pressing <code>Ctr+Shift+F10</code>. You should see "Hello World" in the console.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you have a starting place to write your own programs! In the future, you can use the green play button in the top right of the IntelliJ window to run your code if you forget the key combination.</p>
