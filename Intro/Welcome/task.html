<h1>About This Course</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Boulder High Robotics Java training course! This is the first in a series of courses that will teach you everything you need to know to get started on programming our robots. For our competition robots, we use the Java programming language, which is the language we'll use in this course.</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Noah Mollerstuen. I'm a senior at Boulder High and this year's software captain. Feel free to contact me with any questions; this is our first year using this course, so there will probably be mistakes and things that are unclear. The fastest way to contact me is to send a message in the #code-training channel on the Discord server. You can also send me an email  at <b>noah@mollerstuen.com</b>, or just ask me at our next meeting.</p>
<h2>Course Structure</h2>
<p>This course is divided into a series of lessons. You can see the list of lessons on the sidebar on the left of the screen. Each lesson will have one or more tasks for you to complete. There are several different types of tasks: Theory, where you just need to read something (this is a theory task), Programming, where you will write a short program to be checked automatically, and Quizzes, simple multiple choice questions (I won't use these often, if at all).</p>
<p>You can skip tasks if you get stuck, but you should try to complete the lessons in order, as they will often build on each other.</p>
<h2>How to use IntelliJ</h2>
<p>This application, IntelliJ, is the tool we use to write code. It has a <em>lot</em> of advanced features, but for now you'll just need to know the basics. Here's a quick tour.</p>
<h3>Project View</h3>
<p>The left sidebar is called the Project View. The Project View shows all of the lessons and tasks in this course. To switch to a new task, double click on it. When you're not in a course, the Project View will instead show all of the files in the current project.</p>
<h3>Task Description</h3>
<p>On the right side of the screen is the task description (what you're reading right now). When you start a new task, check the Task Description for new information and an explanation of what your program should do. At the bottom of the description, there will be an option to check your code (for programming tasks), or an option to continue (for theory tasks).
<h3>Editor</h3>
<p>Between the Project View and the Task Description is the Editor, the space in which you will write your code. I'll explain how to write and edit Java programs more in the next few lessons. Because this is a theory lesson, anything you put in the editor will not be checked.</p>
<p>Good job making it through that block of text! Click the "Next" button below to continue to the first programming task.</p>
