<h1>Program Structure</h1>
<p>Let's take a look at the basic structure of a Java program. Here is the basic program you will start with for  most of the programming exercises:</p>

<p>You can ignore a lot of that for now. The important part is that you should write your solution on the lines between the two curly braces highlighted in yellow. When you run your program, every line between those two braces will be executed as an instruction.</p>
<p>Right now, there are two lines non-empty lines between the braces. You can add as many empty lines as you like to keep things organized, they won't do anything when the program is run. The first line (<code>// Write you solution here</code>) is a comment. Any line that starts with two forwards slashes is considered a comment and will be ignored when the program is run. Comments are useful to communicate to other people reading your code (and your future self) about what a particular piece of code is doing.</p>
<p>The other non-empty line is <code>return "Hello!";</code>. "return" is the instruction to output something from the program. In this case, the program will output the word "Hello!". Note that the quotation marks are not part of the output. As with Python, strings need to have a quote mark on either side. Note that you can not use single quotes interchangeably like you can in Python. Finally, every statement in a Java program must end with a semicolon. It's easy to forget, but your program won't run if you forget it. Thankfully, IntelliJ is pretty good at showing you where the error is if you miss one.</p>
<p>It's a common tradition for your first program in a new language to output a "Hello World" message. To complete this tasks, edit the program so that it outputs <code>Hello World!</code> and click on the "Check" button.</p>
