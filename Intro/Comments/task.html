<h1>Comments</h1>
<p>In the last lesson I mentioned that any line that starts with two slashes is a comment and is ignored when the program is run. This type of comment only applies to one line. However, Java also has multi-line comments. You can start a multi line comment with <code>/*</code>, and every line after that will be considered a comment until a matching <code>*/</code> is reached. Multi-line comments are helpful when you want to give more than a sentence of explanation about your code.</p>
<p>Another thing comments can be used for is temporarily removing a statement or a group of statements from your code. You can easily ignore a specific line by putting <code>//</code> in front of it, or you can use a multiline comment to remove a whole block of code.</p>
<pre><code>
  public static String solution() {
        // This is a single line comment

        /*
        This is a multi-line comment.
        Both are ignored when the program is run.
         */
    }
</code></pre>
<p>To complete this task, add or remove comments to make the program output "Robots are awesome!".</p>
