<h1>Intro to Arrays</h1>
<p>Sometimes, your programs will need to keep track of a list of variables. For example, if you wanted to keep track of the names of everyone in the club, you could create a separate variable for each one. However, this would become nearly impossible for, say, the names of everyone in Boulder High. In this case, you would use an array. Java's arrays are somewhat similar to Python's lists, but with a few exceptions I'll cover in a minute.</p>
<pre><code>
  // Arrays have brackets after the variable type
  int[] myArray = {4, 1, 2}; // Create an array of integers
  String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob"} // Create an array of strings
</code></pre>
To show that a variable is an array, you must put a set of brackets after the type of the variable. All elements in the array must have the same type. To get one of the elements of an array, you use the position of the element. The first element of an array is at position 0, the second is at position 1, ect. Counting from 0 may seem weird but it makes a lot of math much easier.
<pre><code>
  String firstName = names[0]; // Alice
  String secondName = names[1]; // Bob
  names[0] = Albert;
</code></pre>
Arrays in Java have a fixed length. That means once the array has been created, you cannot add or remove elements, though you can change the value of each element individually.
<pre><code>
  int[] myArr = {1, 2, 3};
  myArr[3] = 4 // IndexOutOfBoundsException
</code></pre>
You can get the length of an array (the number of elements it contains) using <code>myArr.length</code>. This can be useful to make sure you aren't trying to access elements that don't exist.
<pre><code>
  // Gets the last element of an array
  int lastElement = myArr[myArr.length - 1];
</code></pre>
