<h1>Lists Practice 1</h1>
<p>For this task, you are given two ArrayLists of length 2. Combine them both into one list, keeping the order. Try to do this task by modifying one of the input lists, instead of creating a new list.</p>
<pre><code>
  [1, 2], [3, 4] -> [1, 2, 3, 4]
  [-3, 10], [15, 4] -> [-3, 10, 15, 4]
</code></pre>
