# Landsharks Java Training Course
This is a interactive course for the IntelliJ EduTools plugin. It's intended to teach beginners everything they need to know to start programming for the RoboRIO. This course is currently under development, and new lessons and assignments are added regularly.
## Getting Started
To get started with this course, follow these steps:
1. Download Jetbrains' IntelliJ IDE [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download). Unless you already have a license for the ultimate edition, choose the community edition.
1. When you run the installer and open IntelliJ for the first time, you can leave all the settings at their defaults, except for the screen asking about plugins. There should be an option to intall the EduTools plugin, and you should do so. If the EduTools plugin is not an option, finish the installation, then go to Configure -> plugins and search for and intall the EduTools plugin.
1. If you don't have Git installed, download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it.
1. In IntelliJ go to "Get From Version Control". Choose Github. You will need to provide your GitHub credentials (or an access token). Copy and paste this repository's url into the "url" field and choose "clone".
1. Once the course had been downloaded, got to File->Project Structure. Select the "SDKs" tab under "Platform Settings". If no SDKs are listed, click the "+" button to add one. Choose "Download JDK". You can leave all the options at their defaults, just press "Download".
1. Once the JDK has finished downloading, you should be ready to start. If you have any issues, contact us on the team Discord server, or email [1157landsharksrobotics@gmail.com](mailto:1157landsharksrobotics@gmail.com).
