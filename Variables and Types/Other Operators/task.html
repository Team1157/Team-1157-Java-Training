<h1>Other Operators</h1>
<p>We've already covered most of the important operators (+, -, *, /, &&, ||, ect.), but there's some that don't fit in the other lessons or have different input and output types. We'll cover some of them now.</p>
<h2>Assignment Operators</h2>
<p>You've already seen one assignment operator: <code>=</code>. Assignment operators set the value of a variable. In addition to <code>=</code>, there are several more.</p>
<pre><code>
  a += b; // Same as a = a + b
  a -= b; // Same as a = a - b
  a *= b; // Same as a = a * b
  a /= b; // Same as a = a / b
  a++;    // Same as a += 1 or a = a + 1;
  a--;    // Same as a -= 1 or a = a - 1;
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, these new assignment operators are just shorthand for commonly used pieces of code.</p>
<h2>Comparison operators</h2>
<p>Comparison operators allow you to compare two numbers. They always return a boolean value. The <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators from the last task are comparison operators. Here's the full list:</p>
<pre><code>
  a == b // True if a is equal to b
  a != b // True if a is not equal to b
  a > b  // True if a is greater than b
  a < b  // True if a is less than b
  a >= b // True if a is greater than or equal to b
  a <= b // True if a is less than or equal to b
</code></pre>
<p>Also, you can use parentheses to set the order of operation, similar to algebra</p>
<pre><code>
  (true || false) && true // true
  true || (false && true) // false
</code></pre>
<p>For this task, you will be given three integers. Return true is a is the largest, otherwise return false.</p>
