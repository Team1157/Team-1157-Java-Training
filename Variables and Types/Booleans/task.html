<h1>Booleans</h1>
<p>Booleans are one of the simplest types in Java. A boolean variable can only have two states: true or false. Booleans can be useful for keeping track of things that can only be one on two things, like whether a motor is on, or whether it should rotate forwards or backwards.</p>
<code>boolean test = true;</code>
<p>The are several operators that can be done on one or more boolean variables. Here are some of them</p>
<pre><code>
  boolean c = !a; // True only if a is NOT true
  boolean c = a && b; // True only if a AND b are both true
  boolean c = a || b; // True only if a OR b are true (or both)
  boolean c = a == b; // True only if a and b are the same
  boolean c = a != b; // True only if a and b are different
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators can be used for numbers as well, to test if two numbers are equal or not equal.</p>
<p>For this task, you will be given three boolean variables: a, b, and c. Return true if a and and b are both true, or if c is false (or both). Otherwise, return false.</p>
