<h1>If Else Practice</h1>
<p>In this task, you will be given a single float value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of some event. Your program should return a string contain the phrase that best describes the probability, according to this table:</p>
<pre><code>
  0    <= p < 0.25  |  "very unlikely"
  0.25 <= p < 0.5   |  "unlikely"
  0.5  <= p < 0.75  |  "likely"
  0.75 <= p < 1     |  "very likely"
</code></pre>
<p>If your first solution includes multiple return statements, try to come up with a second solution that uses only one.</p>
