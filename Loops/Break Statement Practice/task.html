<h1>Break Statement Practice</h1>
<p>For this task, you will be given an array of integers of an unknown length. Find the index of the first 0 that appears in the array. There will always be at least one 0. Use a break statement to break out of the loop once a zero has been found.</p>
<pre>
  [0, 5, 3, 10] -> 0
  [4, 2, 0] -> 2
  [2, 0, 0, 4, 1] -> 1
</pre>
