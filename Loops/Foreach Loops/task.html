<h1>Foreach loops</h1>
<p>If for loops are just more convenient while loops, then foreach loops are just more convenient for loops. Foreach loops are used to run a block of code <em>for each</em> element of an array or arraylist, just as you did in the last few lessons. Here's what they look like:</p>
<pre><code>
  // Any type of array can be used
  String[] robotNames = {"Flapjack", "Tanky", "Gary"};

  for(String name : robotNames) {
      System.out.println(name);
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The loop will run once for each element in the array, with the variable declared in the initializer being set to the value of each element in turn. Of course, the same thing can be done with a regular for loop, this just save a line or two of code.</p>
